# ServerAliveInterval - Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server,
# ssh(1) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.
# The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server.
# This option applies to protocol version 2 only.


# ServerAliveCountMax
# Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be sent without ssh(1)
# receiving any messages back from the server. If this threshold is reached while server
# alive messages are being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the
# session. It is important to note that the use of server alive messages is very different
# from TCPKeepAlive (below). The server alive messages are sent through the encrypted
# channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by
# TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client or
# server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
